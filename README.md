## `dictzip` for Windows 10 (x64)

This project provides `dictzip` utility for Windows 10 (x64), built with [MinGW-w64 9.0.0](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/tag/11.2.0-12.0.1-9.0.0-r1).

It requires no additional dependencies and is meant to be used primarily for compressing ABBYY Lingvo .dsl source files 
(one of the [GoldenDict's](https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict) supported dictionary file formats).

The source files are based on the official [dictd](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict/) v1.13.0,
with minor tweaks.
